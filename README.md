# Description

This task involves configuring the Postgres structure with a static IP. To achieve this, the "sed" command, in conjunction with regular expressions, is utilized to programmatically manipulate the configuration file. The aim is to add new environment variables, specifically focusing on the Postgres connection string. Once the configuration is complete, the next steps involve testing, building, and running the application using npm.
